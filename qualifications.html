        Why Computer Engineering? Throughout my childhood I used basic technology but it was not until I received my first phone that the specific interest began of not only what I could do but how it worked. Using my phone plus an increase technology usage in school for projects and assignments developed a personal curiosity in understanding the intricacies of what I was using. I began to take apart old radios and little electrical items and I began to keep up with what was new and upcoming in the technology sector. In early high school I gained a specific interest in building computers and compiling parts lists. Throughout high school I helped multiple friends build PC's. Java will always hold a special place in my heart being the first language I learned and in 2019 I took a class centered in Java that revolved around basic computer science principles. Amazingly I specifically remember my teacher talking about very basic sorting theory and with a scoff he said, "JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU GET TO RED BLACK TREES". It is so cool looking back on that now after creating an entire project centered around it and being able to physically see the knowledge I have gained. At some point I had this epiphany like "Hey, if I am using something every day should not, I understand its basic routine maintenance". After this thought I began to dive more into device cleaning, replacing, and repairing parts, and general knowledge of what I am using. These discoveries over time increased my passion and unlocked a new technological rabbit hole for me to explore. Overall, when it came time to choose a Major I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do but I knew I enjoyed coding and physical components, so I simply combined the two and ended up here.
