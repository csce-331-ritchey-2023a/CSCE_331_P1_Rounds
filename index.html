					My name is Jake Rounds, I am an undergraduate student at Texas A&M University currently pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering as well as a Minor in Cyber Security. Through in and out of class projects I have worked to tangabalize my childhood passion of computers. I am from Katy, TX. I have always had an interest in Programming as well as Electrical concepts, so I combined the two found that Computer Engineering is a perfect fit. My current projects revolve around Python, C++, C, and HTML but I am proficient in R, JavaScript, and Java as well. I have been able to further my technical knowledge as a member of the Aggie Coding Club. Additionally, as a member of one of Texas A&M's Menâ€™s Organizations, Paradigm, I have grown a lot specifically in my time management as well as had the opportunity of participating in many service events.
